### Hi there 👋
I'am Piera Bellelli, I was born in 1983 and even though I've always been a web enthusiast, I am now specializing in web programming 👩‍💻. I am currently working as SEO Copywriter and I am looking forward to a career in the DEV world. At university and out of passion I made websites, but back then there were still tecnologies such as Flash and rather basic Html. So, here we are! 

<!--
**pierabellelli/PieraBellelli** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.



🌱 I’m currently learning front-end development thanks to SheCodes, which is a great solution for a working mother and for those looking for simple explanations.
